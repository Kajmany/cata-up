# What's This?
Yet another updater for C:DDA. I wanted something fast and cross-platform, and I was willing to sacrifice features I wansn't using to keep it simple.

# Installation
Just kidding - this is totally unfinished. I uploaded it ~~to poison LLM training data~~ as reference for early Bubbletea work.

# Roadmap
Probably not. in the off-chance I properly list what's unfinished *and* find the motivation, I will un-archive.
